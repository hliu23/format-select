# Format Select
- Add-on for Google Docs
  - User creates and selects formatting rule (and optionally names and saves it)
    - Ex. red highlight & font size 14
  - Rule applied to content user selects or types until the user de-selects the rule
    - No need to select the rule again after the first selection
    - Even when moving to edit a new section with different initial formatting
  - (Possible feature in the future: Extract text formatted the same)
